# Pytholution
## Journey of a mechanical engineer in coding universe
Whenever I come up with an idea or see an exercise that teaches me something, I put it here and have notes to myself.
Once in a while, you may see comments longer than the code itself ðŸ˜… It will change in time, hopefully.

If you are a beginner like me, some of these solutions may teach you too a few tricks. Else, at least you find yourself reading a man's "logbook" over the struggles against the wilderness of Python jungle.
### Let me introduce the examples here:

1) **Three & Five:** This is a simple problem from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) and the quest is to *find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000*. If you are a math lover, I strongly advise you to create an account and start solving harder problems because unlocking solutions there really gives you a sense of achievement at the end.
2) **Factorials:** As the name states, you find the factori... You got the idea.
3) **100-year-old:** Another simple exercise from [Practice Python](http://www.practicepython.org). It's a decent website that gives the solutions beforehand unlike Project Euler. A nice beginner feeder. I'm planning to solve all of the exercises eventually.
4) **Prime Numbers:** Yeah, I know. The title of this code is unprecedentedly mysterious as well. Guess what does it do? :|
5) **Fibonacci Obsession:** And this is how I present my Fibonacci obsession through a computer language.
6) **List Ends:** "Do not underestimate the potential of a simple example." I said to myself. It was an interesting usage of map() function.
7) **The Luggage:** Now this one is funny because it should have been a simple problem from [Practice Python](http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/11/11/20-element-search.html) but it became a game, I don't know how. (The game itself is not funny though. Sorry.ðŸ˜•)
8) **Palindrome:** is one of those things that you already know your whole life but don't know what it's called. This is the only example that I had cheated after giving up and spending hours on the solution. *I defiled my sacred vow to mighty Python already!*
9) **Read from File:** I spent a few hours to figure out the correct ***for*** structure here but it was the most fun part of the example. Then I get rid of the local files and make the code a bit more *online.* And the result? Trust me, it's virus-free. You can execute it without wearing a mask. \*coughs\*
